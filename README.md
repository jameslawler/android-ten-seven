# Ten 7
This is a simple android application useful for me and anyone else who might catch the same train
as me. It is a simple display that shows the number of minutes and seconds until my next train
(that is every ten minutes at 7 minutes past).

# Concepts

* TDD - the logic was built using TDD
* Android - Runnable threading for the countdown and simple layouts.
